<h2>JSON APIs</h2>

JSON:API is a specification (not a separate API) that defines how servers and clients should structure and exchange data using JSON. Its main purpose is to standardize API responses, so developers donâ€™t have to reinvent their own JSON formats for every project.

- is a specigfication/standard that defines how data should be sent and received in JSON
- goal: to create a consistent format for data exchange
- example: if you have a 'user' resource, JSON API says that the response should look like this?

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "users",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

- this is useful because every API following JSON API looks the same, making it easier to build client-side integrations.

KeyFeatures:
- Consistent format: Defines how resources, attributes, relationships, errors, pagination, and filtering should be represented in JSON.
- Interoperability: Any client that understands JSON:API can work with any server that implements it.
- Efficiency: Reduces the amount of data transferred by supporting sparse fieldsets, includes, and batching.
